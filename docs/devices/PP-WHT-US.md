# Securifi PP-WHT-US

| Model | PP-WHT-US  |
| Vendor  | Securifi  |
| Description | Peanut Smart Plug |
| Exposes | switch (state), power, current, voltage, linkquality |

## Notes


### Pairing
Additional steps are required because the Peanut Smart Plug does not provide a `modelId` in its database entry,
and thus Zigbee2MQTT cannot identify the product or how to handle it.

Reset the device and initiate pairing mode by holding the pairing button
(the small button next to the on/off button) for ten seconds, releasing the button,
and unplugging the device.
When plugged back in, the front LED will be blinking red and ready to receive a pairing request.
When paired successfully, the red LED on the plug will stop blinking.

After pairing, you must stop Zigbee2MQTT and manually edit the Zigbee2MQTT `database.db` file with a
text editor (note that the file may be owned by root).
Find each line where the Peanut Smart Plug is listed (look for "SecuriFi Ltd." in the `ManufName` field)
and **add** `"modelId":"PP-WHT-US",` between two existing fields.

*For example,* change `..."manufId":4098,"manufName":"Securifi Ltd....`
to `..."manufId":4098,"modelId":"PP-WHT-US","manufName":"Securifi Ltd....`
on each line for the device.

Save the file and restart Zigbee2MQTT.


### Power measurements
This device only support power measurements with an up-to-date firmware on the plug which can only be done
via the original hub. In case of an older firmware you will only see 0 values in the measurements.
Discussion: https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/809
''Update'' -- as of 2021-05-14 -- OTA update pushed the latest firmware to the device- which appears now to successfully be reporting instantaneous power usage, both Current and Power.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Current (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current.
Value can be found in the published state on the `current` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
